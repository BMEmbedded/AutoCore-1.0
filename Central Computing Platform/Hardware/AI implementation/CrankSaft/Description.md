Using a neural network to process the crank signal can involve the following steps:

1-Collect a dataset of crank signals and corresponding outputs. In this case, the output could be the current engine RPM.

2-Preprocess the data to remove any noise and normalize the inputs and outputs.

3-Design and train a neural network using a machine learning framework such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.

4-Evaluate the performance of the trained model on a validation set of data. Adjust the network architecture and training parameters as needed to optimize performance.

5-Integrate the trained neural network into the central computing platform. This can involve writing code to load the model, perform inference on incoming crank signals, and send the output (e.g. predicted RPM) to the engine control system.

6-Test and validate the entire system in a real-world setting, and iterate on the design as needed.
