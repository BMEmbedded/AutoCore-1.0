# Used Framework: 
RTOS (Real-Time Operating System) is an operating system designed for real-time applications. It provides a predictable execution model for time-critical tasks and can respond to events and interrupts in a deterministic manner. An RTOS typically includes a scheduler that determines which task to run next and provides mechanisms for synchronization, communication, and memory management.

FreeRTOS is a popular open-source RTOS that is suitable for building the central computing platform for AutoCore. It includes a small kernel and a range of libraries and drivers that can be used to develop applications for various microcontrollers. FreeRTOS supports multiple architectures and has been ported to many different platforms, making it a flexible and versatile choice for embedded systems.

One of the key benefits of using an RTOS like FreeRTOS is that it provides a deterministic execution model. Tasks can be scheduled and prioritized based on their urgency, and the scheduler can ensure that critical tasks are executed on time. This can be important for time-critical applications, such as automotive systems, where a missed deadline could lead to a serious safety issue.

Another benefit of using an RTOS is that it provides a higher level of abstraction than bare-metal programming. The RTOS handles low-level details such as scheduling, synchronization, and memory management, allowing the developer to focus on the application logic. This can result in faster development times and more reliable software.

However, using an RTOS also introduces some overhead in terms of memory usage and processing time. The developer needs to carefully manage the task priorities and ensure that the system has enough resources to meet the real-time requirements.

Overall, an RTOS like FreeRTOS can be a good choice for building the central computing platform for AutoCore. It provides a predictable execution model and a higher level of abstraction than bare-metal programming, making it easier to develop and maintain real-time applications.

# WiFi module: 
This module is necessary for wireless communication and connectivity. The ESP32 module is a popular choice for its low cost, high performance, and built-in WiFi capabilities.

# Memory: 
The system will need both program memory and data memory to store and execute the software. Flash memory and SRAM are commonly used for this purpose, since our microcontroller come with an external memory interface we can add an external flash memory
to increase performance.
# Power management: 
The system will need to manage power consumption and supply, so power management ICs like voltage regulators, power switches, and battery chargers will be necessary.

# Communication interfaces: 
The system will need to communicate with various sensors, actuators, and other systems in the vehicle. Common communication protocols include CAN, LIN, SPI, I2C, and UART.

# User interface: 
The system will need to provide a user interface for the driver, such as a dashboard display. This could be a touchscreen LCD display, with a suitable graphics controller and touch sensor.

# Security components: 
As the system will be responsible for critical vehicle functions, it will need to have secure boot and firmware update capabilities, as well as encryption and other security features to prevent unauthorized access and tampering.
