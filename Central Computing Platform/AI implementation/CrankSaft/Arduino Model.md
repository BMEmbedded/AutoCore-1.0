This code assumes that the crank sensor is connected to analog pin A0, and the ignition is connected to digital pin 2. The neural network weights and bias are defined as constants, and the input value is normalized to a range of -1 to 1 using the formula (crank_value - 512) / 512.0.

The neural network output is calculated using the formula y = w0*x + w1*pow(x,2) + w2*pow(x,3) + bias, and if the output is positive, the ignition is turned on using digitalWrite(ignition_pin, HIGH).

The input and output values are printed to the serial monitor for debugging purposes.
