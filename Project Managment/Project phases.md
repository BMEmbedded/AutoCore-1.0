## Define the requirements: 
Identify what features and functionalities you want to include in the AutoCore system. Consider the target vehicle, engine, and transmission types.

## Research: 
Conduct thorough research on the necessary hardware components, software tools, and programming languages needed for the project. Also, research relevant automotive standards and regulations.

## Design: 
Create a detailed design for the AutoCore system, including the hardware components and the software architecture.

## Prototype: 
Build a prototype of the system to test and refine the design. Start with a small scale prototype and gradually scale up to a full-sized prototype.

## Testing: 
Perform rigorous testing on the prototype to ensure it meets the project requirements.

## Integration: 
Integrate the AutoCore system with the vehicle and perform tests to ensure proper functioning.

## Refinement: 
Continuously refine the system through feedback from testing and user experience.

## Documentation: 
Document the project thoroughly, including the design, code, and testing procedures, to ensure ease of maintenance and future development.

## Release: 
Decide on the best way to release the AutoCore system, whether as a commercial product, open-source project, or other options.
