# AutoCore

AutoCore is a revolutionary automotive system designed to provide the ultimate control and management of your vehicle's electronics. Our goal is to offer a high-performance, reliable, and user-friendly solution for all automotive enthusiasts, small car companies, and individual car developers who want to take their vehicles to the next level.

AutoCore consists of three main components: the central computing platform, the extender, and the power distribution and management unit. The central computing platform serves as the brain of the system, controlling every aspect of the vehicle's electronics, including the engine control unit (ECU), body control module (BCM), and other controllers. The extender is responsible for managing the inputs and outputs of other peripherals in the car, and it communicates with the central computing platform using multiple communication buses, including the main CAN bus. The power distribution and management unit converts the alternator voltage to a fixed 12.6V, charges and protects the battery, and supplies the necessary power to all of the car's components.

AutoCore is designed with the user in mind. We have developed a desktop application that allows you to tune and set the parameters for all of the components, making it easy to set up and customize the system to work with your specific vehicle. To simplify the wiring process, we have also included a modern touch screen dashboard that connects to the computing platform and gives you access to the peripherals, allowing you to control them with the touch of a finger.

In addition to its impressive functionality, AutoCore is also focused on safety and security. We plan to implement modern AI technologies into our system, such as autopilot and advanced security features, to make driving safer and more secure than ever before.

At Carrova Automotive, we are committed to providing high-quality products at an affordable price. We understand that our customers are looking for a cost-effective solution that doesn't compromise on performance or reliability. We believe that AutoCore offers the best of both worlds, and we are confident that it will revolutionize the automotive industry.

AutoCore is the future of automotive technology. With its advanced features and intuitive design, we believe that it will set the standard for automotive systems for years to come. Join us in our mission to take your vehicle to the next level with AutoCore.
