The power distribution and management unit is an essential component of the AutoCore automotive system. It is responsible for converting the alternator voltage to a fixed 12.6V, charging and protecting the battery, and supplying the necessary power to all of the car's components.

Here are some of the functions and features of the power distribution and management unit:

Voltage regulation: The power distribution and management unit regulates the voltage coming from the alternator to ensure that it stays at a fixed 12.6V. This ensures that all of the car's electrical components receive a consistent voltage, which is essential for their proper functioning.

Battery charging and protection: The power distribution and management unit also charges the car's battery and protects it from overcharging or undercharging. This helps to extend the life of the battery and ensures that it is always ready to provide power when needed.

Power distribution: The power distribution and management unit distributes power to all of the car's components, including the central computing platform, the extender, and the various peripherals. It ensures that each component receives the correct amount of power and that there is no voltage drop or fluctuation.

Fault protection: The power distribution and management unit is designed to protect the car's electrical system from faults such as short circuits or overloads. If a fault occurs, the unit will isolate the affected component to prevent damage to the rest of the system.

Current monitoring: The power distribution and management unit monitors the current flowing through the system to ensure that it is within safe limits. If the current exceeds a certain threshold, the unit will take action to prevent damage to the system.

Temperature monitoring: The power distribution and management unit also monitors the temperature of the system to prevent overheating. If the temperature exceeds a certain threshold, the unit will take action to prevent damage to the system.

Overall, the power distribution and management unit plays a crucial role in ensuring the proper functioning of the AutoCore automotive system. Its functions and features are designed to ensure that the system is reliable, safe, and efficient, and that all of the car's electrical components receive the power they need to operate properly.
