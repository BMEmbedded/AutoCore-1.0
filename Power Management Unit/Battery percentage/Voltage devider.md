One effective method to estimate the battery percentage of a 12V lead acid battery is to measure its voltage and compare it to the voltage of a fully charged battery and a completely discharged battery.

First, measure the voltage of a fully charged 12V lead acid battery and note down the value. Let's say this value is V1.

Next, measure the voltage of the battery that you want to estimate the percentage for and note down the value. Let's say this value is V2.

Then, measure the voltage of a completely discharged 12V lead acid battery and note down the value. Let's say this value is V3.

Now, you can use the following formula to estimate the battery percentage:

Battery Percentage = ((V2 - V3) / (V1 - V3)) * 100

This formula assumes that the discharge curve of the battery is roughly linear between the voltages of a fully charged battery and a completely discharged battery, which is usually a good approximation for lead acid batteries. However, note that this method does not take into account factors such as temperature, battery age, and load current, which can affect the accuracy of the estimation. Therefore, it is important to calibrate the estimation periodically and use it as a rough estimate only
