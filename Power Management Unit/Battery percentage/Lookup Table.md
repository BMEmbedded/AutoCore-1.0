Another method to estimate the battery percentage accurately is by measuring the battery's voltage and comparing it to a lookup table that maps the battery voltage to its state of charge. This method takes into account the non-linear discharge behavior of the battery and can provide more accurate readings.

To implement this method using an Arduino, you can use an analog input pin to measure the battery voltage and then use a switch-case statement to compare it to the lookup table.
