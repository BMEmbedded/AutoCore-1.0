## Central computing platform: 
The central computing platform is the brain of the system and is responsible for controlling all of the vehicle's electronics. It includes a microcontroller unit (MCU), which runs the system software, and interfaces with various input and output devices.

## Extender: 
The extender manages the inputs and outputs of other peripherals in the car, such as sensors, actuators, and displays. It communicates with the central computing platform using multiple communication buses, including the main CAN bus.

## Power distribution and management unit: 
The power distribution and management unit converts the alternator voltage to a fixed 12.6V, charges and protects the battery, and supplies the necessary power to all of the car's components.

## Desktop application: 
The desktop application is a software interface that allows users to tune and set the parameters for all of the AutoCore components. It includes features such as real-time data logging and visualization, parameter editing, and firmware updates.

## Touchscreen dashboard: 
The touchscreen dashboard is a modern interface that connects to the central computing platform and provides access to the peripherals, allowing users to control them with the touch of a finger. It includes features such as customizable gauges and widgets, and real-time data visualization.

## AI technologies: 
AutoCore incorporates AI technologies such as autopilot and advanced security features to enhance safety and security. For example, autopilot uses machine learning algorithms to control the vehicle's steering, acceleration, and braking, while advanced security features use AI to detect and respond to cyber threats.

## Peripherals: 
AutoCore is compatible with a wide range of peripherals, including sensors, cameras, GPS systems, and other devices. This enables advanced features such as lane departure warning, collision avoidance, and autonomous driving capabilities.
