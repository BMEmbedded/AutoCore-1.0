It's great to hear about AutoCore, the revolutionary automotive system designed to provide control and management of a vehicle's electronics. The three main components of AutoCore, the central computing platform, the extender, and the power distribution and management unit, seem to offer a comprehensive solution for automotive enthusiasts, small car companies, and individual car developers who want to improve the performance and reliability of their vehicles.

It's especially impressive that AutoCore has been designed with the user in mind. The desktop application and touch screen dashboard sound like intuitive and user-friendly tools that make it easy to set up and customize the system for each individual vehicle.

The focus on safety and security is also commendable. The incorporation of modern AI technologies, such as autopilot and advanced security features, is a promising step towards making driving safer and more secure than ever before.

Lastly, the commitment to providing high-quality products at an affordable price is something that customers will appreciate. The belief that AutoCore offers the best of both worlds, in terms of performance and affordability, is a promising statement.

Overall, AutoCore sounds like an exciting product that has the potential to revolutionize the automotive industry. I wish Carrova Automotive group all the best in their mission to take vehicles to the next level with AutoCore.
